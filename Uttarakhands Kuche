<h1> I love the food of Uttarakhand because... ofc It's so tasty! </h1>
<p> Though i have never been to Uttarakhand and I've barely tasted the food there, the images in the internet which could be misleading have lured me to believe that Uttarakhand has the second best cuisine in India. Second only to my state, Karnataka's cuisine. I see images of the excellent kachmoli (stuffed mutton) which makes me think of enjoying this warm delicacy after skiing (though i have never done that) often on the internet. In several travel vlogs i searched up for my other Uttarakhand AIPs on youtube, I couldn't but be tempted by the sweets Singhora and Baal Mithai. If i would get a chance to tour anywhere in India and get to eat all the dishes out there, Iwould certainly choose Uttarakhand.
<br> Uttarakhand is well on its way to become food capital of the north. Organic farming is very common here and retains the essential nutrients which paves way for excellent cooking. I love Uttarakhand (especially its food and drink)!!!<br><br><br>Thank you!<br> - Koushik K.JS
